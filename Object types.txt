Object types
There 5 types of objects in R :
Vectors
Lists
Factors
Matrices
Data Frames Out of which we will study Vectors, Matrices and Data Frames in detail.




# vectors
x= c(2,4,6,8,10,12) #c() function will collect elements as a listed group
x 

y= seq(from=2,to=12,by=2) #seq() function will output a sequence
y

z = 1:10
z

r = sample(2:12, size =6 , replace =T) #sample() will generate random sequence of numbers
r

s = sample(2:12, size =6 , replace =F)
s
